Hi! Iâ€™m Priyanka, Analyst passionate about transforming data into visual stories. I'm upskilling with hands-on Power BI projects and case studies.

Let me introduce you to Extra learn 

ExtraaLearn is a startup that offers programs on cutting-edge technologies to students and professionals to help them upskill/reskill. With a large number of leads being generated on a regular basis, one of the issues faced by ExtraaLearn is to identify which of the leads are more likely to convert so that they can allocate resources accordingly. You, as a Data Analyst at ExtraaLearn, have been provided the leads data to:


* Analyze and build an model to help identify which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers

* Find the factors driving the lead conversion process

* Create a profile of the leads which are likely to convert
